# Secure LLM Gateway

A middleware layer that enables secure routing, screening, and governance of LLM usage within organizations. This project demonstrates a progressive approach to building a secure gateway for LLM interactions, integrating GitGuardian for sensitive data detection and implementing a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server.

## Project Overview

As organizations adopt LLMs internally, security and control become critical requirements. This project provides a practical architecture for implementing a secure LLM gateway that helps organizations:

- Route requests to appropriate LLM models
- Screen for sensitive information in prompts and responses
- Govern LLM usage safely
- Integrate with internal tools and data sources

## TODO List

### Phase 1: Simple HTTP-Based Deployment
- [ ] Set up basic AWS Lambda function for the gateway
- [ ] Implement HTTP endpoint for prompt handling
- [ ] Add model selection in request payload
- [ ] Configure AWS IAM roles and permissions
- [ ] Set up model forwarding to AWS-supported LLMs
- [ ] Add basic error handling and logging
- [ ] Create initial API documentation

### Phase 2: GitGuardian Integration
- [ ] Set up GitGuardian API integration
- [ ] Implement prompt screening using GitGuardian Secrets Detection
- [ ] Add response screening functionality
- [ ] Create sensitive data redaction system
- [ ] Implement match location handling from GitGuardian API
- [ ] Add logging for security events
- [ ] Create monitoring for screening results

### Phase 3: Chunking & Truncation System
- [ ] Implement input chunking logic
- [ ] Add output chunking system
- [ ] Handle GitGuardian API limits (1MB)
- [ ] Create chunk reassembly logic
- [ ] Add validation for chunked content
- [ ] Implement error handling for chunking operations
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for chunked operations

### Phase 4: MCP Server Implementation
- [ ] Create serverless MCP Server in AWS Lambda
- [ ] Implement GitGuardian screening in protocol layer
- [ ] Add organizational tool integration support
- [ ] Set up RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities
- [ ] Implement LLM routing logic
- [ ] Add action chaining functionality
- [ ] Create pre-processing pipeline
- [ ] Set up enrichment system
- [ ] Implement access control mechanisms
- [ ] Add monitoring and observability
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
